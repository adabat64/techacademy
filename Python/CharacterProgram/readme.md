This program is a slightly modified version of the program created in the Python In A Day Book 2,
which I used in conjunction with the Tech Academy to get grasp in the basics of Python 2 and 3.
For more on how to create a simple GUI like this one using python, you can buy the books or go to the website inadaybooks.com

To run the GUI, download the folder and run the file simpsonGUI.py either using the command prompt or idle.
wxPython needs to be installed for the program to execute.

This version includes a GUI and a database.
The GUI features:
  -Adding new characters
  -Viewing characters
  -Updating characters
  -deleting characters.
